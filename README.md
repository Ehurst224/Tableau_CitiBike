# Phenomenon #1 - New Jersey customers leaving bikes in the city
Both New Jersey member and casual riders are starting their rides in New Jersey. Most riders return back to New Jersey, while others do not return to New Jersey, or take alternative transportation home. We see this when looking at the start and end side by side maps. You can see both casual and member riders ending their rides all across New York.

# Phenomenon #2 - New Jersey tourists find long summer rides to be enjoyable
In the summer months there is an increase in casual users due to tourism.  Although all the users in our data set started in New Jersery, this is still the case as we see casual riders increase starting in June through September.  In October, casual ridership drops off in the winter months.  In addition, in the past 12 months, casual rider duration is twice as long as member riders.
